# appfoster
This is test plugin for appfoster, on activation of this plugin two pages get created
1. one inside the admin dashboard with link http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=app-foster
2. and second on the site http://example.com/test/ nad the data is fetched from the link you have provided in the test assignment.
3. For making http://example.com/appfoster/test/ we will need to change the post permalink. 
4. The fetched data on the page has been displayed in a jQuery datatable in which you can sort the table columns and search the data in search box provided above the table, if the data comes in large amount then the pagination will help in that.
5. There is a JS and a CSS file of the plugin in their apropriate folders.
